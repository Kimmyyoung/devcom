# DEVCOM

## üñ• Overview

**_DEVCOM - Developer Community_**

The application caters to developers, offering a platform where they can explore job postings, stay updated on developer events, engage in meaningful conversations with peers, and efficiently manage their schedules. 

### üìç Problem

When I attended the Demo Day and networking event at BrainStation, I encountered numerous individuals already established in the tech industry or aspiring to enter it. Curious about their discovery of the event, I inquired from several attendees, and their responses varied‚Äîsome discovered it through EventBridge, while others stumbled upon it on Reddit, and so forth. This prompted me to contemplate the idea of creating a centralized app that consolidates comprehensive information on developer events and job opportunities, providing a one-stop platform for the tech community. 

### üìç User Profile

The app is tailored for individuals actively employed as Software Engineers or Developers, as well as those with a keen interest in the tech industry. It serves as a dedicated platform to connect, share information about job opportunities, and stay informed about upcoming events within the tech community.
